I discovered my love for data science in 2020, since then, I've been focused on learning how to improve my knowledge in this area.

I'm fascinated by machine learning and statistical models. 👨🏽‍💻
Also, I have some expertise with Microsoft Office and Google Workspace dealing with database manipulation and building data storytelling. 📈

About my personal life, I like to read comics (specially DC) and some science fiction books (Dune is my favorite). In my free time, I'm always playing videogames.
