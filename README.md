I discovered my interest in data science in 2020, since then, I've been focused on learning how to improve my knowledge in this area.

My goals are to become an expert in SQL and Python to manipulate databases and create value for data-driven decision-making.
As for my personal life, I enjoy reading comics and books. Also, I'm always playing video games or getting to know a new restaurant.
